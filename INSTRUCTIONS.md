# Project instructions


The goal of this project is to create a REST API to retrieve a list of files matching a certain filter query as part of a cloud storage service.



## You can start with these three filters:

- find files matching a given extension
- find files that are below a given size
- find files that are above a given size


## Requirements:

- The API should also allow to retrieve supported filters
- The API should allow to combine the filters together using "and" and "or" operations
- It should be easy for a developer to add new filters to the application


## Deliverables:

- A Python implementation of the API server
- A Dockerfile to build a docker image of the server
- Instructions to build a server Docker image and spin it off locally
- 2 or 3 unit tests covering the most important parts of the system


## Evaluation criteria:

- maintainability and readability of the code
- ease of use of the application


## How to submit
- Create a private repo on your GitHub and push your code there
- Add users "theoallard", "saswatac", "pierre-yv", "leilakany", "d-gol" and "matthieu-bernard" as collaborators
- Submit the link to your GitHub repo below, along with any comments you might have about your solution (note that at least a short comment is required)
